## Introduction
This is Assigment 3 for the TU Delft course EPA133A Advanced Simulation. Here, we expand the model from the previous assigment by adding the N2 road and all sideroads with the N1. The goal of the assigment is understanding which infrastructure is critical in Bangladesh. The country is prone to natural disasters, such as floods and cyclones. Here, we investigate which bridges must be prioritized to improve, in order to limit the disruptions during a natural disaster.

In this assigment we set up the components for an agent based model making use of the library MESA. Moreover, we use the tools of the package NetworkX in order to create the road network and its dynamics.

The model runs a scenario in which a natural disaster occurs and the bridges are damaged. One can define the change a bridge falls down depending on the condition of the bridge. The model will simulate the vehicles driving on the road and the impact of the damaged bridges on the travel time.
