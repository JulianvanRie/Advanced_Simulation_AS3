## Introduction
This is assignment 4 for the course Advanced Simulation at the TU Delft. In this assignment we analyse the road and bridge network in Bangladesh to determine which bridges & roads are most critical and vulnerable.

## File Description

This file contains the following files:
- data: this file contain the input data for the model.
- img: this file contains the images created during the model run.
- model: this file contains the main model, which are just jupyter notebooks this time.
- report: in this file the final report is located.

The model is rather simple this time and exist out of data-cleaning, network creation and network analysis.
